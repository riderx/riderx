    "summary": "Entrepreneur in love with new technologies! I think they allow us to stay focused on the core business of the company and save valuable time, which is why I chose developer studies at Epitech which gave me the tools to transform a Idea in project effectively.  Startup guy in soul, I would like to build the new disruption of tomorrow. I particularly appreciate the sharing economy sector.  Currently obsessed with Angularjs, Nodejs, Firebase and Ionic. I firmly believe that these are the most suitable technologies for the startup world.  With a good team spirit and my overall vision of the objectives, I am able to lead projects, this position in a team stimulates me and allows me to question myself every day. In order to satisfy my need to learn, my adaptability and my creativity, I need an innovative and exciting environment .  I dream of a world where each person could benefit from the same UX with the best quality without worrying about the terminal it owns.",
